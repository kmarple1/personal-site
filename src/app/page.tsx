              Welcome to my personal site. My name is Kyle Marple, and until recently I was a staff software engineer at
              Walmart Global Tech. I&apos;m currently looking for a new role, but until I find one, I&apos;ll be using
              this site as my personal playground and portfolio, both to keep my skills sharp and to show off what I can
              do. Please keep in mind that I&apos;m not a UX designer, so this is mainly a tech demo.
