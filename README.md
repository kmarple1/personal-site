# Personal Site and Portfolio for Kyle Marple

This repository is designed to serve as both my personal website and a portfolio to demonstrate my capabilities with React as well as various packages and frameworks. As such, many of the packages used will be overkill for such a small site, but that is intentional. You can view the deployed site at [kylemarple.com](https://kylemarple.com), or run the site locally by following the instructions below.

## Running the Site Locally

First, clone the repo, then install the required packages and run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Running Unit Tests

After you have the repo cloned and the packages installed, you can use the following command to run the unit tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Storybook

To run Storybook, clone the repo and install the dependencies as above, then run the following command:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your browser to see the result.
